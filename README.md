# dotterweide

The dotterweide projects aims to develop an embeddable mini-IDE with support for the Scala programming language. Please refer to the
`docs` directory for further information, in particular see the [faq](docs/faq.md).

It was first proposed on the [Scala Contributors](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/who-would-help-creating-an-embeddable-mini-ide/)
forum. We created a corresponding [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/dotterweide/dotterweide-org) for the basic communication. Feel free
to ask questions and to join.

This `-org` repository contains mostly text documents about organising the project, while actual code is found in other repositories.
